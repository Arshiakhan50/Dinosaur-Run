## Features

- **Endless Runner Gameplay**
- Experience classic endless runner gameplay where the goal is to survive as long as possible.

- **Classes and Objects**: The game's elements, such as the dinosaur, cacti, and birds, are implemented as Python classes. Each class encapsulates both data (attributes) and methods.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is utilized to create specialized classes for different game elements (e.g., Dino, Cactus, Bird), inheriting common attributes and behaviors from a base class.

### Dynamic Difficulty
- As you progress, the game gets progressively more challenging with faster obstacles.
- Collecting more points unlocks even greater speed challenges.

- **Collision Detection**: Implemented using Pygame's `Rect` objects, checking for collisions between the dinosaur and various obstacles (cacti, birds).
